\arguments{
\item{callbacks}{list of callback functions
List of callback functions that are applied at each iteration.}

\item{data}{a \code{lgb.Dataset} object, used for training}

\item{early_stopping_rounds}{int. Activates early stopping. Requires at least one validation data
and one metric. If there's more than one, will check all of them
except the training data. Returns the model with (best_iter + early_stopping_rounds).
If early stopping occurs, the model will have 'best_iter' field.}

\item{eval_freq}{evaluation output frequency, only effect when verbose > 0}

\item{init_model}{path of model file of \code{lgb.Booster} object, will continue training from this model}

\item{nrounds}{number of training rounds}

\item{params}{List of parameters}

\item{verbose}{verbosity for output, if <= 0, also will disable the print of evaluation during training}
