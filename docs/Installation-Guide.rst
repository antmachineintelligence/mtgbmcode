Installation Guide
==================

Here is the guide for the build of LightGBM CLI version.

All instructions below are aimed to compile 64-bit version of LightGBM.
It is worth to compile 32-bit version only in very rare special cases of environmental limitations.
32-bit version is slow and untested, so use it on your own risk and don't forget to adjust some commands in this guide.

For the build of Python-package and R-package, please refer to `Python-package`_ and `R-package`_ folders respectively.

Also you can download artifacts of the latest successful build in master branch: |download artifacts|.

Windows
~~~~~~~

On Windows LightGBM can be built using

- **Visual Studio**;

- **CMake** and **VS Build Tools**;

- **CMake** and **MinGW**.

Visual Studio (or VS Build Tools)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With GUI
********

1. Install `Visual Studio`_ (2015 or newer).

2. Download `zip archive`_ and unzip it.

3. Go to ``LightGBM-master/windows`` folder.

4. Open ``LightGBM.sln`` file with **Visual Studio**, choose ``Release`` configuration and click ``BUILD`` -> ``Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)``.

   If you have errors about **Platform Toolset**, go to ``PROJECT`` -> ``Properties`` -> ``Configuration Properties`` -> ``General`` and select the toolset installed on your machine.

The ``.exe`` file will be in ``LightGBM-master/windows/x64/Release`` folder.

From Command Line
*****************

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ (3.8 or higher) and `VS Build Tools`_ (**VS Build Tools** is not needed if **Visual Studio** (2015 or newer) is already installed).

Build GPU Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux GPU version of LightGBM can be built using **OpenCL**, **Boost**, **CMake** and **gcc** or **Clang**.

The following dependencies should be installed before compilation:

-  **OpenCL** 1.2 headers and libraries, which is usually provided by GPU manufacture.

   The generic OpenCL ICD packages (for example, Debian package ``ocl-icd-libopencl1`` and ``ocl-icd-opencl-dev``) can also be used.

-  **libboost** 1.56 or later (1.61 or later is recommended).

   We use Boost.Compute as the interface to GPU, which is part of the Boost library since version 1.61. However, since we include the source code of Boost.Compute as a submodule, we only require the host has Boost 1.56 or later installed. We also use Boost.Align for memory allocation. Boost.Compute requires Boost.System and Boost.Filesystem to store offline kernel cache.

   The following Debian packages should provide necessary Boost libraries: ``libboost-dev``, ``libboost-system-dev``, ``libboost-filesystem-dev``.

-  **CMake** 3.2 or later.

To build LightGBM GPU version, run the following commands:

.. code::

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM ; cd LightGBM
  mkdir build ; cd build
  cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 ..
  # if you have installed NVIDIA CUDA to a customized location, you should specify paths to OpenCL headers and library like the following:
  # cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 -DOpenCL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libOpenCL.so -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/cuda/include/ ..
  make -j4

Windows
^^^^^^^

On Windows GPU version of LightGBM can be built using **OpenCL**, **Boost**, **CMake** and **VS Build Tools** or **MinGW**.

If you use **MinGW**, the build procedure is similar to the build on Linux. Refer to `GPU Windows Compilation <./GPU-Windows.rst>`__ to get more details.

Following procedure is for the **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) build.

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ (3.8 or higher) and `VS Build Tools`_ (**VS Build Tools** is not needed if **Visual Studio** (2015 or newer) is installed).

2. Install **OpenCL** for Windows. The installation depends on the brand (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) of your GPU card.

   - For running on Intel, get `Intel SDK for OpenCL`_.

   - For running on AMD, get AMD APP SDK.

   - For running on NVIDIA, get `CUDA Toolkit`_.

   Further reading and correspondence table: `GPU SDK Correspondence and Device Targeting Table <./GPU-Targets.rst>`__.

3. Install `Boost Binaries`_.

   **Note**: Match your Visual C++ version:
   
   Visual Studio 2015 -> ``msvc-14.0-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2017 -> ``msvc-14.1-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2019 -> ``msvc-14.2-64.exe``.

4. Run the following commands:

   .. code::

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -A x64 -DUSE_GPU=1 -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_63_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0 ..
     # if you have installed NVIDIA CUDA to a customized location, you should specify paths to OpenCL headers and library like the following:
     # cmake -A x64 -DUSE_GPU=1 -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_63_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0 -DOpenCL_LIBRARY="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/lib/x64/OpenCL.lib" -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/include" ..
     cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release

   **Note**: ``C:/local/boost_1_63_0`` and ``C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0`` are locations of your **Boost** binaries (assuming you've downloaded 1.63.0 version for Visual Studio 2015).

Docker
^^^^^^

Refer to `GPU Docker folder <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/docker/gpu>`__.

Build HDFS Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux
^^^^^

1. Install `CMake`_.

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code::

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM ; cd LightGBM
     mkdir build ; cd build
     cmake -DUSE_HDFS=ON ..
     # if you have installed HDFS to a customized location, you should specify paths to HDFS headers (hdfs.h) and library (libhdfs.so) like the following:
     # cmake \
     #   -DUSE_HDFS=ON \
     #   -DHDFS_LIB="/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.14.4-1.cdh5.14.4.p0.3/lib64/libhdfs.so" \
     #   -DHDFS_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.14.4-1.cdh5.14.4.p0.3/include/" \
     #   ..
     make -j4
